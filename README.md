# Matter Grid

Matter Grid is an incremental game in which you click nodes in a grid to fill them.

Each node you fill gives you matter, which can be used for various things, such as gaining skill points.

You can spend your skill points on multiple different paths to make your creation of matter faster.

> For example, one path is focused on granting bonuses for completing rows or columns in the grid (which are called bands).

Eventually, you will get enough matter to perform a reset, which resets all previous content but grants bonuses and unlocks new things.

PROTIP:

> No matter what skills you choose, you can still progress, but if you create a good setup you can progress much faster.
>
> Use the respec button as much as you like to experiment with different skill setups and see which one is best!
